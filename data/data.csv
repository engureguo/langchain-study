Queen Size Sheet Set|I ordered a king size set. My only criticism would be that I wish seller would offer the king size set with 4 pillowcases. I separately ordered a two pack of pillowcases so I could have a total of four. When I saw the two packages, it looked like the color did not exactly match. Customer service was excellent about sending me two more pillowcases so I would have four that matched. Excellent! For the cost of these sheets, I am satisfied with the characteristics and coolness of the sheets.
Waterproof Phone Pouch|I loved the waterproof sac, although the opening was made of a hard plastic. I don’t know if that would break easily. But I couldn’t turn my phone on, once it was in the pouch.
Pillows Insert|This is the best throw pillow fillers on Amazon. I’ve tried several others, and they’re all cheap and flat no matter how much fluffing you do. Once you toss these in the dryer after you remove them from the vacuum sealed shipping material, they fluff up great
Milk Frother Handheld|I loved this product. But they only seem to last a few months. The company was great replacing the first one (the frother falls out of the handle and can't be fixed). The after 4 months my second one did the same. I only use the frother for coffee once a day. It's not overuse or abuse. I'm very disappointed and will look for another. As I understand they will only replace once. Anyway, if you have one good luck.
